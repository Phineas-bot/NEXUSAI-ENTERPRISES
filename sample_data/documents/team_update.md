# Team Update – December

- **Traffic**: Upload volume grew 18% WoW after the desktop sync refresh.
- **Reliability**: Background healing repaired 42 manifests post chaos drill; no customer impact.
- **Roadmap**: January sprint targets gRPC parity for sharing workflows and programmable observability alerts.

Maintainers should attach this update to demo environments so dashboards and audit logs show realistic narratives.
